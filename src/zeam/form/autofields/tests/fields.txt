zeam.form.autofields
====================

The purpose of autofields is to collect fields from different
location. There are group to a form by an interface:

  >>> from zope.interface import Interface

  >>> class IMyFieldSet(Interface):
  ...    pass

  >>> from zeam.form import autofields, base
  >>> class MySpecialFields(autofields.AutoFields):
  ...      autofields.group(IMyFieldSet)
  ...      fields = base.Fields(base.Field('Title'), base.Field('Description'))

And we need to Grok them:

  >>> grok_component("fields", MySpecialFields)
  True

Now, you can create a form with a FieldCollector. It will collect all
defined fields:

  >>> class MyForm(base.Form):
  ...   fields = autofields.FieldsCollector(IMyFieldSet)

  >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
  >>> request = TestRequest()
  >>> form = MyForm(object(), request)

  >>> form.fields
  <Fields>
  >>> list(form.fields)
  [<Field Title>, <Field Description>]
